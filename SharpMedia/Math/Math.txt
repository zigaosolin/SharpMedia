A list of TODOs for Math library. Priorities range from 1 to 10, 1 meaning lowest priority.

- rewrite to templates (10) (all float/double/* stuff)

Shapes:
- support for 2D and 3D shapes (seperate) (10)
- componed shapes implementation
+ Triangulatiom
+-- with holes (8) - done, still needs refinements
+-- 3d projection (6)
+-- optimisations (5)
- quad tesselation correction (7)
- round rect support (9) (at least 2D)
+ Intersection
+-- trinagle-triangle (8)
+-- ray-* (10)
+-- other (6)

Volumes:
- basic volumes (9)
- intergration with shapes, conversion (6)
- much more


Matrix:
- refactor matrix system (10)
- eigen value/vector support (7)
- LU decomposition (8)
- refined Gauss-Jordan (with full support for determinant, inverse and sulotions)
+ sparse matrices
+-- upper tringular (8)
+-- general sparse (6)
+-- vandermonde (3)


Other:

- BigNum with FFT calculations (1)
- Complex support for exponent, functions on complex numbers (sin, cos), power (8)
- Hashing functions for vectors and other basic types refined (10)
- Sparse vectors more efficient implementation (4)
- Spherical harmonics implementation (7)
- Wavelet transform implementation (8)
- Wavelets implementation (8)
- Polynomial root finder (4)
- Min-max algorithm (1)
- differenctial equaltion solvers (Runge Kutta ...) (4)
- minimization (7)
- integration (7)
- generic root finder (5)
- round rect implementation (9)
- signal functions implementation (7)
- non-linear solvers (2)
- statistics - combinatorics (4)
