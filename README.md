Experimental Game Engine in C# (abandoned)

This project contains the a lot of core code for game engine but was abandoned due to lack of time/people.

Feel free to use portions of it for you own code.

Useful things that might be good to check:
- extensive Math library (with generated versions of matrices, vectors quatuernions)
- Graph library with a lot of implementations (I used it to train for International Olympiad in Informatics)
- Shape library
- journaled object "file" system with versioning support
- many useful abstractions (graphics driver, ...)
