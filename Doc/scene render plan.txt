.. Game computes frame, resulting in modifications to the Scene
.. Game calls Render() on the SceneManager
.. SceneManager locks the Scene and "renders" all of the Scene into statistics gathering fake device
.. SceneManager unlocks the Scene, submits frame information to worker threads and returns
.. Game returns to processing another frame
.. SceneManager worker threads compute an optimal plan to render the frame previously submitted
.. SceneManager worker threads render the render plan (using instancing, shared states, textures, shaders, constants...)
